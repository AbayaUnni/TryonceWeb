  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>This is an initiative of a group of farmers who have been successfully engaged in value addition and marketing such value-added agriculture products for a few years. Though the group consists predominately of farmers, there is a multitude of expertise and professional academic background associated with each of them. Their endeavours have always been to bring unique, ethically right, and safe-to-eat produce to a world of adulterated food. The group envisages elevating the quality of life of those marginal farmers associated with it and, at the same time, being responsible and non-compromising in terms of quality and safety towards its customers.
  </br></br>
    The characteristics and tone of the organisation are set, right from the beginning, as an entity to address those critical issues prevailing in the industry. This effectively provides this organisation with a long-term competitive advantage. The infusion of technology is put to optimal use to suit the needs of modern-day consumers.
  </br></br>
    The organisation is engaged in carving a niche path for its own growth in a market that is dominated by various vested groups. The organisation intends to look at the market gap and the pathetic status of the "demand versus supply’ scenario. This enables every stakeholder to relate to any part of the value chain in their own capacity.
    <br></br>
    We, at TryOnce, believe in collaborating with marginal women farmer groups, who happen to earn their livelihoods out of caring for these cattle as their family members. They have been ignored by the mainstream players, and often, even cooperatives have tried to upset their natural and cost-effective feeding practises by inducing branded or manufactured feeds to suit their market demands and seasons. The damage it propels to the animal’s health and, in turn, precipitates in the milk as well, has never been a consideration for these sharks, which neither care for the consumers’ health nor the animal’s health. These hapless women farmers, who are attached to these poor animals, which are not treated as "milk producing machines" (unlike in a farm), have an entirely different culture of treating the cattle. In such a scenario, the loss of their cattle is devastating, both emotionally and financially, for these farmers. Every cow, which is fed only with artificially developed cattle feeds and pellets alone, would undergo a severe deficit in calcium in its body, which eventually led to its death. Most of these animals would not be able to walk without limping at all. That’s a symptom of the deficit, and it leads to more complications and eventually the death of the animals. As a matter of fact, the deficit of calcium in these cows' bodies would definitely reflect in their milk as well.
    <br></br>
    These hapless farmers are finding it difficult to manage pressure from the corporate feeding practises of these conglomerates, including the cooperatives, where they’re forced to buy and use urea-enriched pellets and blood meal-enriched feeds sold by these sharks to suit their marketing needs. This had slowly made them detach themselves from such organisations and ultimately leave them stranded, out of the secured marketing network of these mainstream set-ups. These farmers are grouped together to stand on their own, with continuous awareness of the need for standard hygienic practises through SOPs with the help of rural NGOs and such social engineering organisations.
    <br></br>
    Being farmers of various levels, it gives me immense pride to align with these marginal farmers, who happen to contribute a dominant portion of the milk produced in this country.</p><br><br><br><br>
<h1>Why we deliver in glass bottles?</h1>
<p>On average, 10 crore milk pouches are sold in India every day! One of the numerous problems with milk in plastic pouches is that harmful chemicals are leaching into the milk. Kids are unknowingly swallowing and ingesting toxins that are bad for their health, especially in the long term. 99% of plastics are made from fossil fuels, meaning that they often contain nefarious chemicals such as BPA, phthalates, and styrene. What happens when toxins start seeping into what they are trying to protect? It introduces health risks such as cancer, hormone imbalances, obesity, fertility issues, and reproductive anomalies. We have been delivering milk in hygienic glass bottles for now. We believe that the baby steps that we take on a daily basis will go a long way in protecting our health and our environment.</p>
